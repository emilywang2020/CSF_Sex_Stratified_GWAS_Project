## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(knitr)
library(readr)

# Now read the CSV file from the directory
data <- read_csv("MAGMA/FDR/Male_AB42_gene_APOE_outcome_with_FDR.csv")  # Use your actual file name

# Display the data as a table
kable(data)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
